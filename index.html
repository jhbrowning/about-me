      <h2>About.</h2>
      <p>My name is Joseph Browning. I'm a graphic designer and junior web developer. I'm arts-educated (B.F.A. in Stuido Art) with a professional background in digital marketing, business development, and community relations. After working for four
        years in the non-profit sector, I rejoined an international, corporate law-firm where I was an intern in college. Starting as a marketing coordinator, I was quickly promoted to graphic designer. My role is specifically focused on email
        marketing and publication design. </p>

        <h3>Digital Marketing & Web Development</h3>
        <p>I have grown my creative skills by learning more technical skills and gaining and understanding of a variety of coding languages (HTML, CSS, JAVA) and putting them into practice both professionally and personally.</p>

        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>Visual design is all about telling a story with shapes, color, and composition. With my arts-education and a firm grasp of design principles and software, I've gained a wealth of experience designing web graphics, interactive flyers,
          advertisments, and printed annual reports. </p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I became obsessed with photography after a family trip to New York City when I was 13. I bought a Kodak Easyshare with a whopping 3 megapixels to start my journey to capture and create images. Photography ended up guiding my path to
          college and has allowed me to constantly look at the world in a unique way.</p>
